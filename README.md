# Ananya's Portfolio

## Welcome to my professional journey ##
This portfolio marks the beginning of my web development career. Initially built using HTML and CSS, it served as a foundational project where I applied my basic knowledge of front-end development. Over time, I have actively updated and enhanced this portfolio to reflect my growth and learning, incorporating advanced techniques and modern technologies as my skills have evolved.

With each update, my understanding of responsive design, JavaScript functionality, and user experience principles has deepened, enabling me to create a more polished and professional online presence. This portfolio serves as a testament to my continuous commitment to learning, adapting, and improving as I progress in the field of web development.

Feel free to explore the different versions of my portfolio and witness the development of my skills through each iteration. I look forward to bringing even more updates as I continue to grow and refine my craft.
